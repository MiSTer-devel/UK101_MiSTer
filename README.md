# Compukit UK101 for MiSTer

This core is a port of Grant Searle's UK101 project. It is a reconstruction of a kit computer from the late 1970s, which was based on a 6502 processor.

The core includes some enhancements which Grant added to his own project, such as the 64x32 display. The RAM has been expanded to 32K. 

Saving and loading of Basic programs can be done via the UART, at 9600 baud. Instructions for this can be found on Grant's page and in the manual,
